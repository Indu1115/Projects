My mini project is related to my core and the project is VOICE AUTOMATED CAR.
The main aim of this project is to drive a car using voice in any directions like left,right,front and back.
In this project, no need of humanbeing to drive a car.
The components we used in this project are ARDUINO,BLUETOOTH,MOTORS AND BATTERIES.
First, the voice recognized by an app called BLUETOOTH BOT by humanbeing using smartphone and sending it to car via using wireless technology called bluetooth.
The bluetooth device which is in car paired with smartphone bluetooth and receives the signal which is given by humanbeing.
This bluetooth gives the instructions to the arduino and the arduino performs its operations and sends it to the motors.
The motors which take the electrical energy as input given by arduino and convert it into mechanical energy.
According to instructions given by motors the car will move automatically.
ABOUT COMPONENTS:
=================
we used arduino because it is open source and the language which written in it is understandable and easy and it can run in any OS.
we used bluetooth connection because it is popular wireless connection to communicate pairly within short range.
we used motors to convert electrical energy inti mechanical energy.
we used batteries for power supply of arduino.
USE:
====
These are used in places where man cannot go like mine search etc.
DISADVANTAGES:
==============
The disadvantage is bluetooth range is 10meters only and the time delay of receiving commands also high and the cost is also high.
